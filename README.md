## What is the Solitaire Cipher?

The Solitaire Cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that operates on a deck of playing cards. It encrypts messages by manipulating the positions of cards in the deck according to a key phrase. The resulting ciphered message can then be transmitted securely, with decryption performed by the recipient who possesses the same key phrase and an identical deck setup.

_Inspired by the enigmatic world of cryptography depicted in Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptonomicon', the Solitaire Cipher offers enthusiasts a tangible and engaging entry point into the realm of secure communication._
